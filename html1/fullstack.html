    <h2>What is Full Stack Development?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full stack development is the process of designing, creating, 
        testing, and deploying a complete web application from start to finish.
        It involves working with various technologies and tools, including front-end web development, back-end web development, and database
        development. And full stack development is a term used to describe a software engineer or developer who works with both the front and 
        back end of a website or application. A full-stack developer is comfortable working with front-end and back-end technologies that 
        power a website or application.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-stack developers are often responsible
       for the entire web application development process, from start to finish, which means 
       they must have a strong understanding of all the technologies and tools involved in web development.They also need to work effectively
       with others on a team, as web development is typically a collaborative process. Most full-stack developers have a firm foundation in
       web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They also have experience with server-side technologies such as PHP,
       Ruby on Rails, and Node.js. In addition to their technical skills, full-stack developers also deeply understand how the various parts
       of a website or application work together.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-stack developers are in high demand 
        because they can build a website or application from start to finish and quickly identify and fix any problems that may arise.
        If you're looking to hire a full-stack developer, ask about their experience with front-end and back-end technologies.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1><center>Who are Full Stack Developers?</h1></center>
    <p><center>Full stack web developers can develop the entire web application and website from scratch.
        They have deep knowledge of two-three technologies and are comfortable </center><center> with various 
        other technologies used in software development, forming a T-shaped skill set.</center>
    </p>

    <h2>Front-End</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Client software, also known as a front end,
        is a type of software that interacts with users. It is responsible for the graphical user interface (GUI) that users see and interact
        with. It allows users to access and use the features and functions of the underlying software or system. Client software typically 
        runs on a user's local machine instead of being hosted on a remote server.
        In many cases, the client software makes the user's experience with a particular system or application possible.
    </p>
    <h2>Back End</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Server software, also known as the back-end
        software, is responsible for managing and coordinating the activities of the server.
        It is responsible for ensuring that the server is up and running and that all the different server components are functioning 
        correctly. Server software also provides an interface for users to interact with the server and for administrators to manage the 
        server.Some popular server software programs 
        include Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, and Nginx. These programs handle server-side tasks
        like hosting web pages, taking user requests, and sending responses. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run a website or application, you will 
        need to have a server running server software. This software allows users to interact with your site or application. Without server 
        software, there would be no way for users to request data or information from your site.Server software is an integral part of any
        website or application. It is essential for anyone who wants to run a website or application to have a basic understanding of how 
        it works.
    </p>
    </p>
    <h2>DataBase</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A database plays a crucial role in 
        full-stack development as it is responsible for storing and managing the applicationâ€™s data. 
        It allows the application to persist and retrieve information as needed.

        Full-stack developers work with databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis, to store and query data, ensuring its 
        integrity and efficient retrieval.
